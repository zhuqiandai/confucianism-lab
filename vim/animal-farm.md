"And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural span.For myself I do not grumble,for I am one of the lucky ones.I amtwelve years old and have had over four hundred children.Such is the natural life of a pig.But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end.Youyoung porkers who are sitting in front of me,every one of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year.To that horror we all must come—cows,pigs,hens,sheep,everyone.Even the horses and the dogs have no better fate.You,Boxer,the very day that those great muscles of yours losetheir power,Jones will sell you to the knacker,who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds.As for the dogs,when they grow oldand toothless,Jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.

"Is it not crystal clear,then,comrades,that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings?Only get rid of Man,and theproduce of our labour would be our own.

Almost overnight we could become rich and free.
What then must we do?Why,work night and day,bodyand soul,for the overthrow of the human race!That is my message to you,comrades:Rebellion!I do not know when that Rebellion will come,itmight be in a week or in a hundred years,but I know,as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet,that sooner or later justice will be done.Fix youreyes on that,comrades,throughout the short remainder of your lives!And above all,pass on this message of mine to those who come after you,sothat future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious."And remember,comrades,your resolution must never falter.No argument must lead you astray.Never listen when they tell you that Man and theanimals have a common interest,that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others.It is all lies.Man serves the interests of no creatureexcept himself.And among us animals let there be perfect unity,perfect comradeship in the struggle.All men are enemies.All animals arecomrades."
